    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In India, these thin, gluten-free, vegan dosa are often served for breakfast.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>½ cup chana dal (split chickpeas)</li>
        <li>½ cup urad dal (black lentils)</li>
        <li>½ cup toor dal (pigeon peas)</li>
        <li>¾ cup minced red onion</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons dried hot red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>12 leaves fresh curry</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted ghee, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine rice and all dals in a bowl of cold water; soak for 45 minutes. Rinse several times and drain. Grind into a coarse meal.
        </li>
        <li>Add onion, pepper flakes, curry leaves, asafoetida powder, and salt. Slowly add water and stir until smooth. Let sit in a warm place until is starts to ferment, at least 45 minutes, but ideally longer.</li>
        <li>Grease a frying pan with melted ghee and set over medium heat. Ladle some batter into the pan; spread it thinly and evenly into a circular shape and drizzle with more ghee. Cook until golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes, flipping halfway through. Repeat to cook remaining adai dosa.</li>
